# GitHub desktop installation script

This script will download the most recent GitHub desktop version for ur Linux and, if desired, has the ability to install it as well. If your system does not use deb or rpm packages, it will fall back to the available AppImage.

Tested the script on:
- Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS
- Fedora 37 Workstation
- Mint 21

The project came to life as a result of [berkorbay](https://gist.github.com/berkorbay)'s presumably discontinuedÂ gist page, which can be viewed [here](https://gist.github.com/berkorbay/6feda478a00b0432d13f1fc0a50467f1).

The script will be updated to remove all the todos. Please feel free to contribute.
